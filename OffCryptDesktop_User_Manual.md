   - Creation timestamp
   - Expiration timestamp  
   - Message type and version
   - Session and sender information (X25519)

2. Metadata encrypted using selected algorithm
3. Version byte added to identify disappearing message

#### Decryption Process:
1. System detects disappearing message version byte
2. Decrypts and parses JSON metadata
3. Compares current time to expiration time
4. If expired: Shows expiration notice, blocks access
5. If valid: Returns original message content

#### Expiration Handling:
- **Timing-safe comparison**: Prevents timing attacks
- **Permanent deletion**: Expired messages cannot be recovered
- **Clear error messages**: User informed of expiration status
- **Secure cleanup**: Sensitive data cleared from memory

### Security Considerations

‚úÖ **Cryptographically Secure**: Same encryption as regular messages

## 7. Security Best Practices

### Password Security

#### Master Password Guidelines:
- **Length**: Minimum 12 characters recommended
- **Complexity**: Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- **Uniqueness**: Don't reuse passwords from other services
- **Storage**: Use password manager or secure physical storage
- **Changes**: Update periodically, especially after security incidents

#### Password Management:
```
‚úÖ DO:
- Use unique, strong passwords
- Set password immediately on first run
- Clear password from memory when done
- Verify password before important operations

‚ùå DON'T:  
- Share passwords over insecure channels
- Write passwords in plaintext files
- Use predictable patterns or personal information
- Leave password fields populated when not in use
```

### Key Management

#### X25519 Key Pairs:
- **Generation**: Keys generated using cryptographically secure randomness
- **Storage**: Private keys protected with Windows DPAPI
- **Backup**: Export and securely store public keys
- **Sharing**: Only share public keys, never private keys
- **Validation**: Verify recipient public keys through secure channels

#### Key Lifecycle:
1. **Generation**: Secure random generation with OS entropy
2. **Storage**: DPAPI encryption for private key protection  
3. **Usage**: Memory-safe operations with automatic cleanup
4. **Rotation**: Generate new keys periodically for forward secrecy
5. **Disposal**: Secure deletion when no longer needed

### Communication Security

#### Secure Workflow:
```
1. Verify recipient identity through separate channel
2. Exchange public keys via secure method
3. Verify key fingerprints manually  
4. Use disappearing messages for sensitive content
5. Regularly update trust levels based on interactions
```

#### Trust Verification:
- **Fingerprint Comparison**: Manually verify key fingerprints
- **Out-of-band Verification**: Confirm keys via phone, in-person, etc.
- **Trust Levels**: Use contact trust system appropriately
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review trusted contacts

### Application Security

#### Memory Management:
- Passwords stored as char[] arrays, not strings
- Automatic memory clearing after operations
- Secure disposal of sensitive data structures
- Garbage collection forced after operations

#### Data Protection:
- **Windows DPAPI**: Private keys encrypted with user profile
- **Registry Cleanup**: Settings can be completely removed
- **File Cleanup**: Temporary files securely deleted
- **Clipboard Management**: Automatic clearing after operations

### Operational Security

#### Environment:

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Password Problems

**Issue**: "Password must be at least 8 characters long"
```
Solution:
1. Use longer password (minimum 8 characters)
2. Include mix of character types
3. Avoid common dictionary words
4. Test password strength before setting
```

**Issue**: "Wrong password or data is corrupted"  
```
Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Verify password spelling and case
2. Check for extra spaces or hidden characters
3. Try copying password from password manager
4. Verify data integrity of encrypted text
5. Check if message has expired (disappearing messages)
```

#### Key Management Issues

**Issue**: "X25519 key pair already exists"
```
Solution:
1. This is a security feature to prevent key loss
2. Use existing keys or create new identity
3. For new keys: Go to Identity Manager ‚Üí Create New Identity
4. Export existing keys before generating new ones
```

**Issue**: "Failed to import recipient key"
```
Troubleshooting:
1. Verify key format (should be ASCII-armored)
2. Check for complete key (including BEGIN/END lines)
3. Remove extra whitespace or formatting
4. Verify key is actually a public key, not private
5. Try copying key directly from source
```

#### Encryption/Decryption Errors

**Issue**: Message fails to encrypt
```
Diagnostic Steps:
1. Check if master password is set (Tab 1)  
2. Verify recipient key imported (Tab 2)
3. Check message length (very long messages may timeout)
4. Disable disappearing messages temporarily
5. Check available system memory
```

**Issue**: "Message has expired and was destroyed"
```
Understanding:
- This is normal behavior for disappearing messages
- Message cannot be recovered once expired
- Check creation and expiration timestamps
- Sender must create new message if needed
```

#### UI and Performance Issues

**Issue**: Application runs slowly
```
Optimization Steps:  
1. Close unnecessary applications
2. Increase available RAM
3. Check for Windows updates
4. Restart application periodically
5. Clear clipboard history
6. Run disk cleanup utilities
```

**Issue**: UI elements not responding
```
Recovery Actions:
1. Check if operation is in progress (wait for completion)
2. Verify adequate system resources
3. Restart application if frozen
4. Check Windows Event Log for errors
5. Run application as administrator if needed
```
